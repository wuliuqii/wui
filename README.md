# Welcome to WUI

WUI is a UI framework to create wayland desktop shells and widgets.

## Status

WUI is my hobby project to learn Rust, Wgpu, Wayland and UI programming. It is in early development stage. It is wayland only and will never support other backends.

## Planning

- [] Renderer
  - [] Quad
  - [] Text
  - [] Image
  - [] ...
- [] Wayland Window
- [] UI Elements
- [] Application
  - [] Service(Bluetooth, Network, ...)
  - [] Status Bar
  - [] Launcher
  - ...

## Inspirations

The project from I learned and copied a lot:

- [GPUI](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/main/crates/gpui/README.md)
- [vger-rs](https://github.com/audulus/vger-rs)
